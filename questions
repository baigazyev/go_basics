What command did you use to compile and run your Go program?  go run main.go
What are the basic components of a Go program (e.g., package, import,
function)? Package declaration, import statements, functions, variables, statements and expressions, types, comments.
How does Go handle package imports? Once imported, the package name becomes an accessor for the contents of that package. Conveniently, all the packages in the Go standard library have a package name which is the same as the final element of their import path. That means we can use the Intn() function from math/rand by calling rand.
